# Gate a captured `zfb build` log on link warnings.
#
# ## Why this exists instead of `failOnBroken: true`
#
# zfb's `linkValidation` resolves `#fragment` targets against HEADING-derived
# anchors only. Every anchor the zudo-circuit-doc generator emits is an
# `<EvidenceAnchor>` component id, and all three markup forms were probed
# directly: a heading anchor validates, a raw-HTML `id` warns, an MDX component
# id warns. No markup this generator can emit satisfies the checker, so every
# one of those warnings is false — the links do resolve in the built HTML.
#
# That leaves two obvious options, and both are wrong:
#
#   `failOnBroken: true`   fails every build on thousands of false positives;
#   ignore the log         means a genuinely broken HAND-AUTHORED link never
#                          surfaces, which is the failure mode that matters.
#
# What already covers the generated pages is the package's link-integrity
# assertion, which runs on the VIEW MODEL inside generation and is fatal there — it does not care
# what markup the renderers emit. That independence is also why the warning
# COUNT carries no signal: wrapping the evidence tables in a component dropped
# it from 4324 to 2536 with no change in link health, because zfb does not
# descend into JSX flow elements. Nothing here gates on a count, or on any
# expected number.
#
# ## What this suppresses, and what it refuses to
#
# Two classes are suppressed:
#
# 1. A same-page `#fragment` reported against a file in the generated tree.
#
# 2. The three progress messages printed by `doc-history-server` through the
#    plugin host (`[plugin-host stdout] ` on zfb 2.x, `ZB006 plugin-host:stdout: `
#    on zfb 5): resolved content directory, processing count, and generated
#    history count/timing. Plugin stderr is never suppressed. zfb labels all plugin stdout as warnings even though
#    these lines are informational. Match only those complete message shapes;
#    any other plugin stdout remains unexpected and fails this gate.
#
# Everything else fails — including a `zfb warn:` line whose SHAPE is not
# recognised. That last part is deliberate: if zfb changes its warning format,
# an unrecognised line has to turn CI red rather than silently switch this gate
# off.
#
# Known unrecognised shape, deliberately NOT suppressed: @takazudo/zfb >=2.14.0
# prints ``zfb warn: plain CSS import `<path>` was dropped: ...``. If that
# appears, a stylesheet really was dropped from the build — fix the import,
# don't add it here.
#
# ## Liveness, not a count (#127)
#
# The gate must not go silently green when zfb changes how it prints warnings.
# ANSI colour sequences are stripped and `zfb warn:` is matched anywhere on the
# line, so a colourised, timestamped or otherwise prefixed line is still seen.
# zfb >= 5 inserts a diagnostic code (`zfb warn: ZB001 <path>: broken link: ...`);
# only that one code shape is accepted for the generated-anchor class.
#
# Two presence checks then refuse a log this gate cannot have read correctly:
#
#   - the log must contain zfb's build-complete line (`N pages built`), so an
#     empty, truncated or wrong file never passes;
#   - while the generated component tree holds pages, at least one
#     generated-anchor warning must have been recognised. Those warnings are
#     produced by construction today, so seeing none means the warning format
#     or zfb's link validation changed, and the gate needs review rather than
#     a pass.
#
# Neither check compares against an expected number: one recognised line is as
# good as 4492. Set ZFB_LINK_GATE_EXPECT_GENERATED=0 only for a build whose
# generated tree is genuinely empty.
