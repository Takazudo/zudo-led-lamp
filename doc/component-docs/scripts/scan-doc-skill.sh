# Scan the docs-to-agent skill output for denied evidence values.
#
# `setup:doc-skill` exposes this site's content to Claude Code and Codex as a
# lookup skill. That makes it a publication surface: whatever the generated
# component pages contain is what an agent reads back, and it reads it as
# reference material rather than as a web page.
#
# The script writes to `$HOME/.claude/skills` and `$HOME/.codex/skills` by
# design. This harness therefore runs it with HOME pointed at a throwaway
# directory, and verifies afterwards that the real ones were not touched — an
# epic acceptance criterion and a hard safety rule. It never passes --target
# auto, because auto probes $HOME.
#
# The isolated corpus is assembled here rather than scanned through the skill's
# own `docs` symlink: that symlink resolves to the MAIN worktree by design (so
# it survives worktree removal), and what needs scanning is the content of the
# checkout being tested.
